Recent graduate from Makers Academy, one of the top rated developer bootcamps, hoping to start a new challenge in a rewarding career as a software developer.
I have a degree in engineering and have under taken numerous roles, both technical and non-technical. 
I am looking for a position where I can be of value, be able to create something meaningful, while utilising my strong logic skills and my passion for solving puzzles!

## Skills

#### Communication

Effective communicator from my customer facing roles with clients and within teams I have worked in.
I've worked with a wide range of people, and have adapted to each situation as required. 
In my role as a General Advisor, I further explored a client's issue and then explained complex information in a flexible manner and related it to a client's situatiom.
I found in all the teams I worked in, good and efficient communication was key to being successful. 

#### Adaptability

In my role as a Support Engineer, I was tasked with inputting complex engineering equations into a piece of software that was being developed. With no prior experience in computing, I quickly picked up the necessary skills to successfully complete this job.
Again, in this role, due to a light workload at the time I was trusted to work on projects outside the department. This meant dealing with new people, working with different systems and understanding new concepts.
